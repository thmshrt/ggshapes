[["index.html", "Showcase ggshapes About Motivation Purpose Installation Caveat", " Showcase ggshapes Thomas Hart About Motivation As scientific ideas become more complex, it is essential that we build reproducible methods of communicating these ideas. The grammar of Hadley Wickhams ggplot2 has made this happen for plots. However, the plot is just one of many components of a scientific visualization. What the scientific community needs is a grammar of figures. ggshapes is the beginning of a project aimed at doing just that. Purpose This book is meant as a showcase of the functionality of ggshapes. It is not a white paper for its parent project on developing a grammar of figures. Installation ggshapes will be available in CRAN as soon as it becomes stable install.packages(&#39;ggshapes&#39;) For now ggshapes can be installed from github using library(devtools) devtools::install_github(&#39;thmshrt/ggshapes&#39;) Caveat ggshapes is currently in alpha mode and therefore is undergoing rapid changes to achieve a uniform syntax and stability. The goal for ggshapes version 0.0.1 is January 1, 2021. "]]
