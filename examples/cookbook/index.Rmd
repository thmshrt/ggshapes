# About {-}

## Motivation {-}

As scientific ideas become more complex, it is essential that we build 
reproducible methods of communicating these ideas. The grammar of Hadley 
Wickham's `ggplot2` has made this happen for plots. However, the plot is just 
one part of scientific visualization. What the scientific community needs is 
a grammar of figures. `ggshapes` is the beginning of a project aimed at doing
just that.

## Purpose {-}

This book is meant as a showcase of the functionality of `ggshapes`. It is not
a white paper for its parent project on developing a grammar of figures.

## Installation {-}

`ggshapes` will be available in CRAN as soon as documentation is complete using

```r
install.packages('ggshapes')
```

For now `ggshapes` can be installed from github using

```r
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github('thmshrt/ggshapes')
```
