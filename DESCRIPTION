Description: As scientific ideas become more complex, it is essential that we build
    reproducible methods of communicating these ideas. The grammar of Hadley
    Wickham's `ggplot2` has made this happen for plots. However, the plot is just
    one of many components of a scientific visualization. What the scientific community needs is
    a grammar of figures. `ggshapes` is the beginning of a project aimed at doing
    just that.
